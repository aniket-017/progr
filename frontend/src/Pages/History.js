          <div class="hisinfo">
            <p>
              Progressive Construction Co (PCC) was formed in the year 1976, by two engineers Mr. C. M. Abhang and Mr.V.
              D. Trivedi. Prior to forming the company, both were associate engineers of L&T. Driven by the
              entrepreneurial passion and the combined talents across various domains the company started with humble
              beginnings.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a vision to create a world-class construction and real estate development company with the highest
              standards of professionalism, ethics and customer service, Progressive Civil Construction Company soon
              earned a reputation for its high quality work and speedy construction. The company very soon ventured into
              building constructions, industrial construction and bridges. The versatile and complex nature of these
              projects, though challenging were integral to the part of the overall growth of the company. This
              diversification has helped in evolving Progressive Civil Construction Company into a leading civil
              construction and infrastructure development company in India.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company has completed over 750 major projects within Maharashtra and other states of India. Our
              clients include leading private companies such as Siemens ,Larsen and Toubro, Asian Paints, Johnson and
              Johnson, Hindustan DorrOliver, Godrej, etc. We have also executed projects for various government
              departments such as PWD (Public Works Department, Maharastra), IRCON (Indian Railways Construction), MJP
              (Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran), BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre), MTP, etc. Our client list includes
